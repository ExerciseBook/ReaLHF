Welcome to ReaL-LLM's documentation!
====================================

.. **Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
.. creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It pulls data from the `Open Food
.. Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
.. *intuitive* API.



**ReaL-LLM** (or *reallm*) is a highly efficient system for large-scale LLM RLHF training.


It introduces a novel technique called *Parameter Reallocation*, which dynamically
shifts model parameters and changes the parallelization strategy during training.
This technique can significantly reduce the communication overhead and improve
GPU utilization in RLHF training, leading to a substantial speedup over the state-of-the-art
open-source systems.



Highlights
====================================

- **Performant**
- **Scalable**
- **Easy to use**
- **Unified**
- **Flexible**
- **Highly efficient**
